# renpool-app

RenPool's client app

## Manually deploy client app

[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-a-react-application-to-netlify-363b8a98a985/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-a-react-application-to-netlify-363b8a98a985/)

Install Netlify CLI: `npm install netlify-cli -g`.

```bash
>> yarn run setEnv:<TARGET_NETWORK>
>> yarn run deploy
```

The app is deployed to [https://renpool.netlify.app/](https://renpool.netlify.app/)

## Usage

1. Open the Brownie console. Starting the console launches a fresh [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) instance in the background.

    ```bash
    $ brownie console
    Brownie v1.9.0 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    ReactMixProject is the active project.
    Launching 'ganache-cli'...
    Brownie environment is ready.
    ```

2. Run the [deployment script](scripts/deploy.py) to deploy the project's smart contracts.

    ```python
    >>> run("deploy")
    Running 'scripts.deploy.main'...
    Transaction sent: 0xd1000d04fe99a07db864bcd1095ddf5cb279b43be8e159f94dbff9d4e4809c70
    Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 6721975
    SolidityStorage.constructor confirmed - Block: 1   Gas used: 110641 (1.65%)
    SolidityStorage deployed at: 0xF104A50668c3b1026E8f9B0d9D404faF8E42e642

    Transaction sent: 0xee112392522ed24ac6ab8cc8ba09bfe51c5d699d9d1b39294ba87e5d2a56212c
    Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 6721975
    VyperStorage.constructor confirmed - Block: 2   Gas used: 134750 (2.00%)
    VyperStorage deployed at: 0xB8485421abC325D172652123dBd71D58b8117070
    ```

3. While Brownie is still running, start the React app in a different terminal.

    ```bash
    # make sure to use a different terminal, not the brownie console
    cd client
    yarn start
    ```

4. Connect Metamask to the local Ganache network. In the upper right corner, click the network dropdown menu. Select `Localhost 8545`, or:

    ```bash
    New Custom RPC
    http://localhost:8545
    ```

5. Interact with the smart contracts using the web interface or via the Brownie console.

    ```python
    # get the newest vyper storage contract
    >>> vyper_storage = VyperStorage[-1]

    # the default sender of the transaction is the contract creator
    >>> vyper_storage.set(1337)
    ```

    Any changes to the contracts from the console should show on the website after a refresh, and vice versa.

## Ending a Session

When you close the Brownie console, the Ganache instance also terminates and the deployment artifacts are deleted.

To retain your deployment artifacts (and their functionality) you can launch Ganache yourself prior to launching Brownie. Brownie automatically attaches to the ganache instance where you can deploy the contracts. After closing Brownie, the chain and deployment artifacts will persist.
